<h1>5.4 Closest integer with the same weight</h1>

**COMMENTS**

Fairly simple problem. Closest y to x will be the same binary with the first different bits in x switched. If weight is 0 or 64, x will not have any different consecutive bits, therefore weight must be between 0 and 64. Once the place of first consecutive bits is found, swapping them is enough to find y. Refer to 5.2 for swapping.
