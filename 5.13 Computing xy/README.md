<h1>5.13 Computing xy </h1>

**INFORMATION/COMMENTS**

Multiplication is done mimicking the grade school algorithm. We take the binary of x and multiply with the binary of y. Iterate until we finish all bits of y. If the bit is one, add x to result. Next iteration multiply x by 2 (by shifting x to left by 1). The addition is done differently. I will revisit it later.
