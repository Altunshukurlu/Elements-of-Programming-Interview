<h1>5.6 String and Integer Conversions </h1>

**INFORMATION/COMMENTS**

Implemented using C++ string function mostly. stringToInt is fairly simple, just read each character from string and add to integer x, by multiplying x by 10 first. Check if string is a negative number beforehand. intToString is a bit more complicated since its not easy to append in the beginning of a string in C++. So basically, read each digit of our integer, append to S and reverse S at the end. Check negativity beforehand.
